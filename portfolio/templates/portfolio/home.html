      I am a certified back-end developer with Python's Django, and I have
      experience with front-end development and design. I am also an educator
      for programming and computer science! Most of my professional experience
      is from teaching children how to code, as well as some private tutoring
      and lessons with all ages. I have a strong passion for coding and an
      arguably stronger passion for learning new things. Please, feel free to
      browse my website and get to know me a bit more!
